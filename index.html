        <p class="lead">
            Sameer Paila is a rising senior at Dublin High school, with a passion for speech and debate, economics, and politics. Noticing the hostile climate that now defines American discourse, Sameer reached out to his community in hopes of teaching a more deliberate and respectful debate methodology to the youth. Moving forward, he wants to cultivate a more objective generation by reaching out to as many children within his community as possible.

        <p class="lead"><i>Sameer is an excellent mentor. He identified my child’s potential and began working with him and my 11 year old is now a confident debater who wants to move on to a competitive level within 1 year of learning under him. Without Sameer’s encouragement & support, he wouldn’t be learning and growing as fast as he is right now. Sameer is a positive influence on my child not only in speech and debate, but also as a young man who thrives to make a difference in the community he lives in. He’s a wonderful, motivated teenager who loves bringing the best out of the kids and his passion for speech and debate shows in all of his work. I highly recommend enrolling your child in one of his classes.</i>

        <p class="lead"><i>I am pleased to say that my son loved the 2019 summer debate camp conducted by Sameer.
          I had asked him to try his classes and it turned out to be a wonderful session that he enjoyed and loved.
          He was looking forward to the classes and did a lot of research on his own for the topics he was assigned.
          I have never seen him this motivated and focused. This camp built his confidence and he enjoys public speaking and debate now.
          It was a major change and I appreciate Sameer for identifying his interest and potential in this.
          
          Sameer is very good at communicating the class details after each class so parents are always in the loop and know what is going on in the class.
          
          He identifies each kid's strengths and weaknesses and focuses on improving them. His class sizes are small, so he is able to give 1-1 attention.
          
          All the topics chosen for debate are on current affairs where the kids work in teams to research and present.
          
          Also at the end of the session, Sameer holds a showcase event for the parents, where we get to witness how much our kids have improved.
          
          Sameer is not only smart and intelligent but a good mentor and role model for younger kids.
          
          I am glad that I had signed up my son for Sameer's debate classes and I would highly recommend them for your kids. </i>

        <p class="lead"><i>I enrolled both my girls (4th and 2nd graders) with Sameer for the public speaking course last winter and I was very happy to see them make very good progress especially with their presentation skills. Also this course did open them up to get away with their stage fear and made them sound more confident in front of a larger audience. I would say this is one class which my girls really looked forward to going to every week. The two weeks summer debate camp helped them to work and coordinate as a team. Also they used the CER model which helps the girls with their school classwork/homework. Sameer gives positive and negative feedback for each kid after every class which helps them build their confidence more and focus on the areas of improvement for the next class. I would highly recommend this public speaking and debate course for your kids.</i>
